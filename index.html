            <h2>Project Name: Engineer's Chess</h2>
			
            <h2>Project Description:</h2> This project will be a voice activated chess game. 
																					The current state of the chess set will be displayed on a central 64x64 LED matrix. 
																					A player will be able to give an input, such as “Alpha-6 to Alpha-7” to the game. 
																					A microphone will take the voice input and transmit to a Jetson Nano. 
																					The Jetson Nano will use that data to determine what move is being requested, then send that data to the STM32 microcontroller. 
																					Programmed logic will determine whether the inputted move is legal, then display feedback through two mirrored LCD text displays. 
																					There will be multiple buttons to control the flow of the game such as undo buttons and reset buttons. 
																					There will also be a settable game timer to optionally be used during the game, that will be displayed on the feedback LCDs. 
																					When this project is complete two players should be able to play a complete game of chess using only their voices to control the pieces.
																					The PCB will be powered through a barrel jack, that will then send 5V to the Jetson Nano. Regulators will then 
																					be used to convert the voltage to 3.3V to power the STM32 microcontroller and the LCD text displays.
																					<br><br>
																					Stretch Goals:
																					<ul>
																					<li>(Hardware): An ability to regulate power to the microcontroller and other low-voltage peripherals using a voltage regulator circuit instead of a purchased module.</li>
																					<li>(Software): An ability to preprocess speech data using digital filters before sending it to the speech recognition algorithm/API to improve performance.</li>
																					<li>(Hardware): An ability to receive speech data on a single board computer using a microphone with an ADC and amplifiers instead of a purchased USB microphone.</li>
																					</ul>
																					

            <h2>Project Specific Success Criteria (PSSCs):</h2> 
                <ol>
                    <li>PSSC #1 (Software): An ability to pass microphone data stored on the Jetson Nano to a speech recognition algorithm.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #2 (Software): An ability to store and modify data within the microcontroller related to game state to efficiently interface with the game logic.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #3 (Hardware): An ability to interface with an OLED feedback display over SPI with the microcontroller.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #4 (Hardware): An ability to interface with a 64x64 LED matrix using a GPIO bit-banging protocol to communicate real-time game state.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #5 (Hardware): An ability to communicate player commands and Jetson Nano control commands between the microcontroller and Jetson Nano using UART.</li>
