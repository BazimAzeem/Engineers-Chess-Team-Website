            <h2>Progress Report for Andy Helton</h2>
            <h4>Week 13:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 4-14-2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            My work this week consisted of completing the packaging and finalizing the project as a whole. I was a part of the whole
            process for the box construction. Fortunately, the pieces all fit together extemely well, making it so that we did not 
            need to make any pieces of the box over again. Due to the need to open the box for our demonstartion to the ECE 477 course
            staff, I decided to add braces in three of the inside corners in the box. For now they have velcro strips to hold the lid, 
            but we may conver to screws for a more permanent solution. The total construction went smoothly and everything fits solidly.
            As we presented our project this week, this is the last progress report for the semester. The only things our team hopes to 
            accomplish with our project from here is to present it at the ECE Spark Challenge and the College of Engineering Design
            Expo.

            <b>Date:</b> 4-7-2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
            This week I continued my work on the packaging for the chessboard. I was able to finish the engraving and cutting for the
            top of the chessboard and the rest of the pieces. While the design itself was not complicated, the laser cutter broke while 
            cutting the piece. I have gained some knowledge now of how the laser printer works and some basic repair. Nevertheless,  
            all of the pieces are now done and the last step is to glue the box together. 
            Another part that took a lot of my time is the Ethical and Environmental Analysis. This document will be 
            available on our teams website. From this point the physical part is almost complete, except for putting the pieces together.
            I hope to do this next week once we are finished with PCB debugging and testing.

            <h4>Week 11:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 3-10-2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
            My work this week was almost exclusively towards the construction of the physical box for our chessboard. I spent almost all of my time this week
            in the laser cutting lab figuring out how to use the machinery and designing the layout of the board itself. Fortunatly, the base of the chessboard
            is the size of the wood sheets I bought, so I did not have to do any cutting for those pieces. Due to the stength of the wood, I felt that doubling
            up on two pieces of wood for the top and bottom pices would help with the structual integrity of the box. The top of the board, has two pieces, both 
            are 240x300 mm in size. The first and top layer, fits arround the LED Matrix, while the second layer is for the board to sit on top of and to be screwed to. 
            The size of the hole for the top layer is 192x192 mm, and the size of the whole of the second layer is 172x172 mm.

                <br/>
            <br/>
            For the sides of the board, becuase we want the faces towrads the player to be at an angle, they needed to be trapezoids.
            These pieces were 300 mm in lower width, 60 mm in height, and 240 mm upper width. These pieces I cut using a band saw. Because, 
            of the sizes of the boards, I found I easier to use the natural edge of the board to use as the base of the trapezoids. This allowed
            me to only make three cut lines rather than four.

                <br/><br/>

            The sides that contain the LCD screens and the Buttons are both rectangle that are 300x67 mm. I again used the band saw to cut the initial
            pieces. Once the pieces were cut, I was able to use the laser cutter to cut the hole for the LCD matrix, the holes for the buttons, and 
            to engrave lettering. I found I could use the laser cutter to shave parts of the wood off, so I put circles around the buttons 
            that were slightly engraved so that the button could be pressed while the wood is below the buttons.

                <br/><br/>

            From here I still need to put all of the pieces together, and I want to stain the wood to help give the wood a better color. These tasks
            will be what I focus on in the upcoming week.

            <h4>Week 10:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 3-10-2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            This week consisted of working on a few aspects of the project. A few of the things that I worked on included finding out and 
            starting towards the physical exterior of the project. I also practiced on sodering. I was able to determine how I am 
            going to construct the casing of the chessboard. We have finalized that we are going to use Balsa wood for the box. I was able 
            to determine where I can go to cut the wood. There is a laser cutting lab in Young Hall that I am working towards getting 
            the ability to use. I have been in contact with workers in the lab and have started the steps neccasary to be able to use the 
            facilities. We have also ordered the materials we are going to use. In addition to the time I spent ensuring that we have a way
            to construct our chessboard, I also practiced some with soldering the PCB. If I want to help solder the main PCB, having another
            team member that can solder will be very helpful. Overall, I hope to accomplish more of the construction next week and to help 
            solder the main PCB as much as I can. Unlike other weeks, I did not conrtibute much to the actual design or implementiation
            of the project but I did a lot of preperation and planning for the later stages of the project that we had yet to accomplish
            or think about.</b><br><br> 

            <h4>Weeks 8-9:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 3-10-2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 14<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            The past two weeks consisted of mainly fousig on getting our Midterm Design Review ready and ensuring that the PCB is able to 
            to be purchased in time. In week 8, I spent a lot of time finalizing the PCB design and schemtic for the Design Review. 
            I also had to complie the work I had done on the schematic and PCB into the design review for presenting. This week I have also 
            been primarly taking the recommendations from the the midterm review and implementing them into the actual PCB design. Beyond that
            I have not implemented anything else into the projct, but making sure the PCB was ready to be bought took priority for me these
            past two weeks so I focused almost exclusivly on that side of the project. The major changes that I made to the PCB were changing
            to use a different oscillator for the clock of the STM32 and connecting BOOT0 to GND through a 100K resistor. Another change
            was switching the 3.5mm TRRS input jack to the correct footprint and allowing for an ability to use any of the TRRS sections
            as the input for our microphone. I decided to add this as some 3.5mm microphones and headphones do not use the regular order
            for AUDIO IN and OUT, the solution allows for me to put all of the TRR inputs from the jack itself into parallel, allowing
            for any of the pins to be used for audio in. <br><br>

            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            This week all of my efforts were towards PCB design and the Midterm Design Review. While I have contributed some
            to the Design Review PowerPoint, I focused on the PCB. I was the main contributer behind the design of the 
            PCB and schematic. From previous weeks, I had already determined a majority of the footrpints, so this week I 
            focused on traces and placement of footprints. By Friday I had already designed the PCB to near completeness.
            On Friday, we meet as a team and there Tyson Kline and myself were able to verify footprints to their real 
            component and buy any last components that we may need. I still want to have a few GPIO pins that are taken out 
            of the STM32 and add a heartbeat LED. Besides those additions, the PCB design is complete. The KiCad 6.0 
            zip file for the PCB project can be found on the course website under the Documents tab.<br><br>

            <h4>Week 6:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 2-17-2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            This week the major contributions I made towards the project was working on the schematic and finalizing the circuit for
            3.5 mm audio input. In order to effectively work on the schematic, I had to ensure that everyone knew what the circuitry
            was for each of the components that they needed on the PCB. I also made sure that we worked on the design for our stretch goals,
            so that if we want to implement them their circuitry is avalable on the PCB. Further work needs to be done for the schematic
            at this point in time, but because we have breadboarded everything that we will put on our PCB, the next step is simply
            converting that to a KiCad schematic. <br><br>

            The portion that took a majority of my time was working on the 3.5mm audio in circuit. I have now implemented a working
            audio in from a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a filter to reduce noise, and an amplification to the signal. The only part for this 
            Part of the strecth goal is the communication to the Jetson Nano from the Analog to Digital, but the wiring for said Interface
            is very simply and known for the ADC. The signal output from the cicuitry I made is pretty good, the audio waves indicate clear
            signals, and when listened to, there is little background noise. One of the designs I added to the cicuit was an LED so that any 
            time I speak into the microphe it turns on, another way of knowing the signal is being picked up without an oscilloscope 
            or listening to the audio directly. I may decide to put this on the PCB as an easy way to see if the cicuit is working in 
            some capacity.

            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            This week I focused a lot of my efforts on starting our PCB design and working on the individual assignment Mechanical
            Overview. I focused less on the headphone jack microphone input, as we are now planning on using a USB microphone. 
            However, the parts for the headphone jack circuitry did arrive this week so I made some rudimentary breadboard designs.
            None of them are quite right yet, but are promising.<br><br>

            <br/><br/>
            Due to the fact that a rough idea of how our PCB will be layed had to be completed for the Mechanical Overview, 
            I decided that I wanted to get a head start on designing the actually PCB. Jack Gardel provided some assistance in 
            showing examples of schematic on KiCad and what parts in particular we need for the PCB. At this point we have all required
            components on our KiCad schematic, some components still need to be wired completely. After I am finished with that, Jack Gardel
            and I will begin to finalize the PCB layout in its completeness.<br><br>

            <h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 2-3-2023<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            This week my work focused on three main areas: microphone input circuitry, learning how to use KiCad, and the Component 
            Analysis document. The Component Analysis can be found on our group website under the Documents tab. Personnally,
            I completed the sections with regards to Analog to Digital Converters and Microcontrollers of the analysis document. The main progress 
            I made in specific regards to the project focus on the microphone inputs and KiCad tutorials.
            <br/><br>
            For the microphone input, I learned how we would implement a circuit such that we would have filtering and 
            amplification on our microphone input. The filter and gain are very necessary for our microphone input. Without 
            the filtering, the microphone would pick up far too many signals that are out of the frequency range that we 
            desire to pick up. The average range for a human speaking is anywhere from 80 to 255 Hz. Without the filters, 
            many more frequencies would be recorded and could interfere with voice recognition. The gain is simply there 
            to increase the input signal from the microphone, as the analog output made from the microphone itself is fairly 
            low. The circuitry for the filter had a recommended circuit in the datasheet for the MCP3008. Later in the week, 
            our team changed a few of our PSSCs. Originally the microphone input to the amplifier, to the filter, to the 
            ADC, to the Jetson Nano was going to be a PSSC. However, we have changed it to be a stretch goal and replaced 
            it with an SPI output to LCD screens. While this does not mean the research done, and resources purchased are 
            for nought, instead we hope to make this type of microphone a stretch goal, so that we can focus on other aspects 
            of the project.

            <br/>
            One such aspect I am also focusing on greatly, is learning how to use KiCad. I have followed, read, and spent
            a few hours just completing many of the basic tutorials, but I am still very much in the process of learning 
            the software so that when we need to design our PCB the software will hopefully be the least of our problems. <br><br>
            
            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 1-27-2023-<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            This week I focused a lot on finding information on microphone inputs and Analog to Digital converters (ADC). In my research, 
            its seems that I have found integrated chips that we could use for an external ADC that outputs to an SPI protocol. The component 
            I found is a MCP3008 - 8-Channel 10-Bit ADC with SPI Interface (pictured below). I spent a couple hour reading the documentation and figuring
            out any additional circuitry that may be neccasary to support the MCP3008. The datasheets provides clear requirements that
            are neccasary to use the MCP3008, for a variety of purposes. Due to the functionality of the MCP3008 being able to have 8 
            input channels, this led to some group conversation about including two microphones for our design functionality, rather than
            a single microphone input. In addition to finding this component, I also found an additional Operational Amplifier that the maker of the MCP3008 suggests 
            to use with the ADC. This particular OpAmp is the MCP601. </br><br>

            Another element that I learned was for the microphone input itself. If we choose to use a 3.5 mm jack (for user ease of use
            and compatibility), then we will need to use either a TRRS (tip, ring, ring, sleeve) or TRS (tip, ring, sleeve) jack. The TRS jack
            would be used with 3.5mm jacks microphones that dont have any audio out, but if we need to use anything that has speakers a TRRS jack will
            be neccasary. I believe, we are leaning towards the TRRS due to many microphones that a user may want to use could also have a speaker, making
            TRS not suitable for our needs or the needs of the user.

            <h4>Weeks 1-2:</h4>
            <b>Date: 1-20-2023</b> <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            The first two weeks, comprised of mostly general design idea, discussion about project functionality, research into 
            the material and components needed for this project, and completing our Final Project Propsal along with the Functional Specification.
            For our Final Project Proposal, we determined what roles everyone will partake in for our group, determined the estimated costs of the project, 
            and further discussed our PSSCs. My contribution to the Functional Specificatoin include, writing the parts of sections 
            4.1 Computational Constraints and 4.2 Electronics Constraints that pertained to game mechanics, not signal proccesing sections.
            In addition to these, our whole group met outside of ManLab wher we discussed further functionality and usablity of our project. 
            </br><br>
            Another part of the project I have contributed to, is the presentation of the project itself. In other words, how do we want
            our chessboard to look and what will it be contained in? Working with Tyson Kline, we narrowed down that we will be using a single
            64x64 LED matrix for the project. Determining this helps inform the genral size that we are aiming to make the chessboard. As the 
            LED matrix comes out to 192x192mm (7.55x7.5inches), this makes it smaller than the general chessboard. 
            This allows for a greater range in materials that could be used for our project, as we are not attempting to find 
            large pieces of an material that could become quite costly. Additonally, I had found a good 
            supply of Balsa Wood that we may make the frame for the chessboard out of. The pieces ar 1/8 inch thick, and are 12x12 inches, 
            providing plenty of space along the edges. This is not a finalized decision, but was well recieved upon initial proposal. 
            I have looked into other materials such as plastics, cardboards, and metals, but as of yet none have seem to be as promising
            as the balsa wood. </br>
